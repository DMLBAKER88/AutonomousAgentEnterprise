# ðŸ§  Autonomous Agent Enterprise â€“ Brain Overview

## Purpose
To build a self-evolving, self-correcting, income-generating autonomous AI system using local models and intelligent agents.

## Core Agents
- **Core (Mission Interpreter)** â€“ Reads and distributes long-term goals
- **Planner-One** â€“ Breaks down goals into high-leverage tasks
- **Executor-One** â€“ Simulates or performs those tasks
- **Loopmind-One** â€“ Reflects, logs outcomes, and proposes system mutations
- **Challenger** â€“ Questions everything, identifies drift, and injects chaos-thoughts

## Architecture
- Loop cycles begin in `run_enterprise.py`
- Prompts live in `/prompts/`
- Goals and logs persist in `/memory/`
- Outputs saved per run in `/logs/`

## Current Model
- Qwen 2.5 (14B) running locally via Ollama
